## Site Structure

Stockholm FC website has 5 visible pages. The [home page](index.html) is the Landing page, [about us](about-us.html), [gallery](gallery.html), [session times](session-times.html) and [bookings](bookings.html). All 5 visible pages are accessible from the navigation menu which is located on the top of all pages. There is a learn more button on the home page which takes you to the about us page. There is also a book now button on all the other visible pages. There is an extra [thank you](thank-you.html) page once you have filled out the form on the bookings page.

## Design Choices

 * ### Typography
      The fonts chosen were '---' for the headings and 'Raleway' for the body text. They fall back to '--' and sans-serif respectively. 
     *  '--' I focused on the body text more as that is where the important information will be so I chose this font as I thought it compliments the body font.
     * 'Raleway' is used for the body text as it is a simple and easy to read font.

 * ### Colour Scheme
      I decided to stick with simplicity when deciding the color scheme for the site. That is why I went with black and shades of grey as the main color scheme.
      I added small details of bright yellow which really complemented the simple design.

#Features

The Stockholm FC site was made to be simple and easy to use. The thought behind this was that parents should not be overwhelmed with information and complicated navigation. For parents that do need further information, they have an easy form on the bookings page.

## Existing Features  
  * ### Navigation Menu

    * Located at the top of all the pages in the site, it is responsive and contains links to all the pages of the site to allow ease of navigation in one location.
    * The logo is clickable with a link back to the home page for enhanced UX.

* ### Home
    
    * This is the landing page where potential visitors will come to once they have entered the site. I have used a background image of a young child shooting a  football. Reason behind this was that I did not feel I would need to add any further information on what the site was about as the image was self explanatory along side keeping everything simple.
    * A persuasive header along with a learn more button was placed next to the image which gives the visitors a close enough button to move on to the next page which is the about us page.
