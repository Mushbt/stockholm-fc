## Wireframes

The wireframes for Stockholm FC were produced in [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com). There are frames for a full width display and a small mobile device. The final site varies a little due to some changes being made during development.

## Site Structure

The Stockholm FC website has 5 visible pages. The [home page](index.html) which is the Landing page, [about us](about-us.html), [gallery](gallery.html), [session times](session-times.html) and [bookings](bookings.html). All 5 visible pages are accessible from the navigation menu which is located on the top of all pages. There is a learn more button on the home page which takes you to the about us page. There is also a book now button on all the other visible pages with exception to the bookings page. There is an extra [thank you](thank-you.html) page once you have filled out the form on the bookings page.

## Design Choices

 * ### Typography
      The fonts chosen were 'Rokkitt' for the headings and 'Raleway' for the body text. They fall back to sans and sans-serif respectively. 
     * 'Rokkitt' was chosen as the header font because it compliments the body font. I focused on the body font because I felt the important information would be in the body.
     * 'Raleway' is used for the body text as it is a simple and easy to read font.

 * ### Colour Scheme
      I decided to stick with simplicity when deciding the color scheme for the site. That is why I went with black and shades of grey as the main color scheme.
      I added small details of bright yellow which really complemented the simple design.

# Features

The Stockholm FC site was made to be simple and easy to use. The thought behind this was that parents should not be overwhelmed with information and complicated navigation. For parents that do need further information, they have an easy form on the bookings page.

## Existing Features  
  * ### Navigation Menu

    * Located at the top of all the pages in the site, it is responsive and contains links to all the pages of the site to allow ease of navigation in one location.
    * The logo is clickable with a link back to the home page for enhanced UX.

![Navigation bar image](assets/images-md/nav-menu.png)


[Back to top](<#contents>)

* ### Home
    
    * This is the landing page, where potential visitors will come to once they have entered the site. I have used a background image of a young child shooting a football. The reason behind this was that I did not feel I would need to add any further information on what the site was about as the image was self-explanatory alongside keeping everything simple.
    * A persuasive header, along with a learn more button was placed next to the image which gives the visitors a close enough button to move on to the next page which is the about us page.
    
![Home image](assets/images-md/home-page.png)
[back to top](<#contents>)

* ### About Us

     * The About us page gives the user more information about Stockholm FC.
     * Three sections were added and they are as followed:
     * Who We Are - Who we are as a football club.
     * What We Believe - What we believe is beneficial for children who are taking the exciting step into football.
     * What We Focus On - Where our focus will be to get their children into the sport of football.
     
     * A book now button was added which takes the user to the bookings page in case they are persuaded enough to choose this football club for their children.

![About-Us image](assets/images-md/about-us.png)

* ### Gallery

     * The Gallery page gives the user an insight into the sessions that we hold.
     * Images have been laid out into separate 'cards' to allow more focus per image rather than have them all contained in one page section.
     * A book now button was added which takes the user to the bookings page in case they are persuaded enough to choose this football club for their children.

![Gallery image](assets/images-md/gallery.png)

* ### Session Times

     * The Session Times page gives the user information on location, and what days and times we hold our sessions for the different age groups we cater to.
     * A map of the location has also been added to make it simple for the user rather than having to search up the address on the internet.
     * A book now button was added which takes the user to the bookings page in case they are persuaded enough to choose this football club for their children.

* ### Thank You

     * The Thank You page is the only non visible page on the site. To get access to this, you must fill out the form on the Bookings page.
     * The Thank You page has a simple thank you message and information on how long they will need to wait for a response from us. This will act as a confirmation page that their form or request has been received by us.
     * The navigation menu is visible incase they would like to go back to any of the main pages on the site.
    
![Thank-You image](assets/images-md/thank-you.png)
[Back to top](<#contents>)

* ### Footer

     * The Footer contains the social media links for Stockholm FC. They open up in new tabs for better UX enhancement.
     * The social media links will provide the users with a further insight into our weekly sessions and will also be a point of reference for users who have already enrolled their children to see what they have been upto in our sessions.

## Future Features 

* An 'Our Coaches' section which will give the users photos and information about the coaches that will be working with their children. We can also add what their sporting background is and what sport diplomas they have.
* A shop section where they can buy our football club merchandise such as football shirts or kits with or without their names printed on the back, footballs and water bottles.

## Known Bugs
* ### Resolved

    * During validation two errors were highlighted, a brief description is below:

    * CSS -
    
    ![W3C CSS Validator test results](assets/images-md/css-error.png)
    
    
    I had used the center value twice for text align which was not needed. This was rectified by removing one center value.

   * Google Maps - 

   ![Google map error](assets/images-md/gmap-error.png)


   I had copied the link to the location but the map would not load on the live site. After some research online, I found a solution to the error on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
   I needed to go onto Google Maps, enter the destination and then click the share button. I needed to copy the link from there for it to work on my live site.

* ### Unresolved
    * No unresolved issues to mention.

## Additional Testing
### Lighthouse
The site was tested using [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) in Chrome Developer Tools to test the pages for the following:
* Performance - How the page performs whilst loading.
* Accessibility - Is the site acccessible for all users and how can it be improved.
* Best Practices - Site conforms to industry best practices.
* SEO - Search Engine Optimisation. Is the site optimised for search engine result rankings.

* The results for the tests are below:
* Home - 

![Lighthouse test results](assets/images-md/lighthouse-home.png)

* SEO was not rated as high as everything else and the reason for that was because the CTA Learn more button was not so descriptive. However, there is a descriptive header above the button which is not taken into consideration during the tests. Image for the SEO test is below.
