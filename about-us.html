            <h3>WHO WE ARE <i class="fa-solid fa-people-group"></i></h3>
            <p>Founded in 2022 with the goal of creating a safe and fun environment for young children to learn and
                play the world's most watched and loved sport. We are licensed
                by the Swedish Professional Football League (SEF) and have many years of experience.
                Currently, we train a team of teenagers, but we also wanted to train children aged 5-12 to be part
                of their exciting journey into the world of football.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>WHAT WE BELIEVE <i class="fa-solid fa-bullseye"></i></h3>
            <p>We believe that all children deserve the opportunity to discover and express themselves, without
                limits,
                to gain confidence in themselves and in everything they try.
                That is why we encourage children to show not only their strengths but also their weaknesses so that
                we
                can better understand them and train them in ways
                that we believe will be fun and beneficial to them.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>WHAT WE FOCUS ON <i class="fa-solid fa-arrows-down-to-people"></i></h3>
            <P>We focus on making sure the children have fun. For this reason, we do not create a competitive
                environment. We believe that a competitive environment
                would keep kids from developing and improving the core skills they need to become football players.
                We
                will focus on basic skills such as running,
                jumping, shooting, catching, and throwing.
            </P>
